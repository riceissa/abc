A collection of information about the University of Washington (and also
college in general).
Currently it’s [too easy to lose things on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-people-find-posts-on-Quora-that-theyve-written-but-completely-forgotten-about), so I am posting here.
Please let me know if there are any other good resources/if there are mistakes here.

Note that on Quora, adding <code>/?share=1</code> to the end of the URL allows you to view *all* answers, not just the first one.

### Atmospheric science

- [What is it like to study Atmospheric Science at the University of Washington?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-study-Atmospheric-Science-at-the-University-of-Washington)
In particular, Alex K. Chen says:

   > Personally, I think the ideal combination would be to major in CS at UW, take the grad-lvl courses (as well as the computational courses) in the Atmospheric Science department, and then do Atmospheric Science research at UW. That way you get an undergrad degree from one of UW's best undergrad programs, and research in a department where you can get more personal attention than almost any other department in the entire school.
