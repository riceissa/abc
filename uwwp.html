A collection of information about the University of Washington (and also college in general). Currently it’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-people-find-posts-on-Quora-that-theyve-written-but-completely-forgotten-about">too easy to lose things on Quora</a>, so I am posting here. Please let me know if there are any other good resources/if there are mistakes here.

Alex says, in part:

<blockquote> Make yourself <strong>extremely</strong> stalkable and Googleable (and clearly mark that you're open to emails and random Facebook friend requests from strangers). And also - archive up *all* the interesting things you've gathered up and put them somewhere that's *ultra-accessible*, so that they can easily find them. Use the cloud as your storage space, and default most of your Facebook status updates to public.</blockquote></li>
